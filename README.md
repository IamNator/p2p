# why use libp2p, how does sending the Solana work here


Using Libp2p in a Solana wallet application can provide several benefits, primarily related to peer-to-peer networking and secure communication. Here's why you might consider using Libp2p and how sending Solana works in such a setup:

1. **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: Libp2p is a modular networking library that simplifies the development of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. When building a Solana wallet, you may want to enable direct P2P communication between wallet instances. For example, you might want to send Solana tokens directly to a friend without relying solely on a centralized server. Libp2p can help establish these P2P connections.

2. **Resilience and Decentralization**: Libp2p allows your Solana wallet to connect to other wallets directly, even without a central server. This makes the wallet more resilient and less dependent on centralized infrastructure. It's especially useful in a decentralized blockchain ecosystem like Solana, where users may want to interact directly with each other.

3. **Security**: Libp2p provides security features such as encryption, authentication, and peer discovery. This ensures that communication between wallets is private and secure. In the context of a Solana wallet, security is of utmost importance because you're dealing with valuable assets.

Now, let's explain how sending Solana works in a simplified Libp2p-enabled Solana wallet:

1. **Wallet Initialization**: When you set up your Solana wallet, you create a unique Solana account. This account contains your Solana tokens and is associated with a public key and a private key. The private key should be stored securely, and it's used for signing transactions.

2. **Peer Discovery**: Your Solana wallet uses Libp2p to discover other wallets on the network. Libp2p helps find the addresses of other wallet users who want to send or receive Solana tokens.

3. **Creating a Transaction**: Let's say you want to send Solana tokens to a friend. You construct a Solana transaction within your wallet, specifying the recipient's public key and the amount of Solana you want to send.

4. **Signing the Transaction**: Here's where your private key comes into play. Your wallet uses your private key to sign the transaction. This signature is essential because it proves that you are the rightful owner of the tokens and authorizes the transaction.

5. **Sending the Transaction via Libp2p**: Your wallet uses Libp2p to send the signed transaction to your friend's wallet directly. Libp2p ensures that this communication is secure and private.

6. **Receiving and Verifying**: Your friend's wallet receives the transaction via Libp2p. They can verify the transaction's signature using your public key to make sure it's really from you and that you have authorized the transfer.

7. **Transaction Confirmation**: If everything checks out, your friend's wallet broadcasts the transaction to the Solana network, where it gets confirmed by Solana validators. Once confirmed, the Solana tokens are transferred from your wallet to your friend's wallet.

So, in summary, Libp2p enhances the Solana wallet by facilitating secure peer-to-peer communication. It helps you discover other wallet users, send signed Solana transactions directly to them, and maintain a decentralized and secure interaction within the Solana network. The actual implementation details can be more complex and involve additional features like error handling and network management.
